    <div class="description">

      A software engineer who is always looking for a new challenge, with over a decade of experience sitting behind a screen and churning out software. From the J2ME days right up to the last Blackberry device to the glorious mobile days right now. An aspiring Nascar racer who loves to build things that helps people get more done, whether with my bare hands or behind strings of code.
      <br/><br/>
       Love playing video games, tinkering and building them on the side too.
Currently trying my hands-on machine learning for automated customer support, beacons for event ticketing, and how to give my 2009 Mazda computer vision (seriously). On my bucket list, is to build a culture rich, puzzled filled but also action-packed, RPG/MMO video game. I release stress and create by listening to EDMs, reading hardware design books and hanging out with family.
<br/><br/>
Currently Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://siriuslabs.io" class="siriuslabs" target="_blank">SiriusLabs</a>, I freelance and launch my own products through my studio - <a href="https://ephod.co" class="ephod">Ephod</a>
